# App

Small spa done by me with:

* vue
* vue-router
* vue-x
* vue-material

It was done to match the design located inside /screenshots/ folder

## Project setup
```
npm install
npm run mock-server # to run server for development
npm run serve       # build and run vue app with hotreload
npm run build
npm run lint
npm run test:unit
```

## Troubleshooting

If you cant find vue-cli-service most likely you dont have node in your PATH environment variable

## Todo

* Tests:
    * [component] App.vue
    * [component] IconBase.vue
    * [component] Login.vue
    * [state manager] store.js
    * [navigation] App.vue
    * [navigation] Login.vue
